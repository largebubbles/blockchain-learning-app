# Problems with Traditional Money

## Learning Objective
Identify limitations of current money systems

## The Middleman Problem

Every time you send money, there's a middleman:
- Your bank
- The recipient's bank
- Payment processors (Visa, Mastercard, PayPal)
- International transfer services (Western Union, Wire services)

Each middleman:
- Takes a fee
- Adds processing time
- Can block your transaction
- Needs to trust the next middleman in line

## Real-World Frustrations

### Problem 1: High Fees
**Example:** You want to send $100 to family in another country.
- Western Union fee: $10-15
- Currency exchange fee: $3-5
- Your family receives: $80-87

Almost 20% lost to fees!

### Problem 2: Slow Transfers
- International wire: 3-5 business days
- Check deposit: 2-3 business days
- Even "instant" transfers only work within the same service

Why does digital money take days to move?

### Problem 3: Limited Access
- 1.7 billion adults worldwide don't have bank accounts
- You need ID, address, credit history to open an account
- Banks can refuse service
- Many countries have unreliable banking systems

### Problem 4: Not Truly Yours
Your bank account can be:
- Frozen by your bank
- Seized by government
- Closed without warning
- Limited (daily withdrawal limits, transfer caps)

## The Trust Requirement

All of this works only if you trust:
- Your bank to keep accurate records
- Your government to regulate fairly
- Payment processors to process transactions
- The system to not fail

And for most people in stable countries, this trust is usually justified! But it's still *required*.

## The Core Question

What if there was a way to send money:
- Without middlemen (or very few)
- With low fees
- Almost instantly
- To anyone in the world
- Without needing a bank account
- Without requiring trust in a single institution

Sound impossible? That's what blockchain and Bitcoin attempt to solve.

## Key Takeaways

- Current money systems rely on multiple middlemen
- International transfers are slow and expensive
- Billions of people lack access to banking
- You must trust institutions to move your money
- These problems create demand for alternatives

## Think About It

Can you think of a time when sending or receiving money was frustrating? High fees, long wait times, or services that didn't work? Keep that experience in mind as we explore alternatives.
