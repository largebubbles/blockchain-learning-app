# From Physical to Digital Money

## Learning Objective
See how money has evolved from physical objects to digital numbers

## The Evolution of Money

### Stage 1: Physical Coins (Ancient Times - 1900s)
Gold and silver coins you could hold in your hand. Heavy and hard to carry large amounts!

### Stage 2: Paper Money (1600s - Today)
Banks would hold your gold and give you paper receipts. Eventually, the paper itself became the money. Much lighter to carry!

### Stage 3: Credit Cards (1950s - Today)
Plastic cards connected to your bank account. No need to carry cash—just swipe!

### Stage 4: Digital Transfers (1990s - Today)
Apps like Venmo, PayPal, Apple Pay. Send money with your phone. No physical money involved at all!

## Here's the Interesting Part

When you check your bank account and see "$1,000," what are you really looking at?

**It's just a number in a database.**

That money doesn't exist as physical cash sitting in a vault with your name on it. It's a digital record that says "this account has $1,000."

## Digital Money Today

Most money is already digital:
- Your salary is deposited electronically
- You pay bills online
- You transfer money through apps
- You rarely use physical cash

According to economists, only about 10% of money exists as physical cash. The other 90%? Just numbers in computers.

## So What Makes Us Trust It?

Good question! We trust digital money because:
- Banks keep records and protect our accounts
- Governments regulate and back the banks
- Laws protect us from fraud
- The system has worked for decades

But here's a question to think about: Do we *need* banks to track digital money? Or is there another way?

## Key Takeaways

- Money has evolved from physical objects to digital records
- Most money today is already just numbers in databases
- We trust digital money because banks and governments manage it
- Trust in institutions is what makes the current system work

## Think About It

If money is already digital, and computers can talk to each other over the internet, why do we still need banks to send money to each other?
