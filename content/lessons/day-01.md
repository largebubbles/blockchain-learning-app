# What is Money?

## Learning Objective
Understand money as a tool for exchange

## The Story of Trade

Imagine you're a farmer with 100 apples. You want a pair of shoes, but the shoemaker doesn't want apples—they want rice. Now you have to find someone who has rice and wants apples, then trade the rice for shoes. This is exhausting!

This problem is called the **"double coincidence of wants"**—you need to find someone who has what you want AND wants what you have.

## Money Solves This

Money is like a universal gift card that everyone accepts. Instead of trading apples for rice for shoes, you can:
1. Sell your apples for money
2. Use that money to buy shoes directly

Simple!

## What Makes Something "Money"?

Money does three important jobs:

1. **Store of Value** - You can save it for later
2. **Medium of Exchange** - Everyone accepts it for trade
3. **Unit of Account** - You can measure the value of things (this costs $10, that costs $50)

## Money Through History

Throughout history, people have used many things as money:
- 🐚 Seashells and beads
- 🏆 Gold and silver
- 📄 Paper bills
- 💳 Credit cards
- 📱 Digital payments

The form changes, but the purpose stays the same: make trading easier!

## Key Takeaways

- Money solves the problem of finding someone to trade with
- It stores value, enables exchange, and measures worth
- Money has evolved from physical objects to digital numbers
- The best money is something everyone trusts and accepts

## Think About It

Most "money" today is just numbers in a computer. When you check your bank balance, you're looking at digits on a screen. If money can be digital, what else could it become?
