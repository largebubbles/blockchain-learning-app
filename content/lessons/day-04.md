# What If We Didn't Need Banks?

## Learning Objective
Imagine peer-to-peer value transfer without intermediaries

## The Email Comparison

Think about sending an email:

**Before Email (Postal Mail):**
- Write letter → Post office → Sorting facility → Delivery person → Recipient
- Multiple middlemen, takes days, costs money

**With Email:**
- Type message → Click send → Recipient gets it instantly
- Direct, instant, (usually) free

Why can't money work like email?

## The Dream: Peer-to-Peer Money

Imagine if you could:
- Send money directly to anyone
- No bank approval needed
- No payment processor taking fees
- Works anywhere in the world
- Arrives in minutes, not days

Just like email, but for money!

## The Problem: Digital Copying

Here's why money can't just be like email—and it's a BIG problem:

**Email can be copied:**
- You send an email → You still have a copy → Recipient has a copy → Both of you have it

This is fine for emails! But for money...

**Money cannot be copied:**
- You send $10 → You have $0 → Recipient has $10 → Only one copy should exist

If digital money could be copied, you could:
- Send the same $10 to multiple people
- Keep spending the same money over and over
- Create infinite money from nothing

This is called the **"double-spending problem"** and it's the biggest challenge in creating digital cash.

## How Banks Solve This

Banks keep a central ledger (record book):
- Your balance: $100
- You send $10 to Sarah
- Bank updates: Your balance: $90, Sarah's balance: $110
- The bank makes sure you can't spend that $10 again

The bank is the **trusted third party** that prevents double-spending.

## Can We Do This Without Banks?

The million-dollar question:

**Can we create a system that prevents double-spending WITHOUT needing a bank or company to track everything?**

For decades, computer scientists said it was impossible. You'd always need some trusted authority to keep the records.

Then in 2009, someone figured it out.

## Key Takeaways

- Sending money directly (peer-to-peer) would be revolutionary
- The main problem: preventing digital money from being copied
- Banks solve this by being the central record-keeper
- For years, no one knew how to do this without a trusted middleman
- Until Bitcoin...

## Think About It

If you could design a system where everyone could verify that money wasn't double-spent, without needing a bank, how would you do it? Keep this question in mind—we'll answer it soon!
